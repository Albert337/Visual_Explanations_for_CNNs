# Visual_Explanations_for_CNNs
I did research in all kind of visual explanations for CNNs since saliency maps and another techniques ending up with Grad-CAM, the newer, which I have implemented a general version that can be used for any model in keras.

Here you can find a presentations with a summary of a the seven I believe more powerful methods to this end, and the implementation of a general grad-CAM from the implementation of @jacobgil in https://github.com/jacobgil/keras-grad-cam/blob/master/grad-cam.py
